[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/dropdog/badge/?version=master)](http://dropdog.readthedocs.io)

A useful manual for Drupal developers, themers and site builders that want to start collaboration work with the new Drupal 8.x staff.

The initial documentation created to help us in the maintenance and development of a complex
Drupal 8.x distribution but became more generic and public available in the future.

Common best practices are in place and new methodologies of development are proposed on this manual.

You can use these Docs for your own purpose under [Open Publication License](https://github.com/dropdog/docs/blob/master/LICENSE).
