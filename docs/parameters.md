## Development parameters
--------------------------
This section contains a matrix of the project technical requirements (delivered) vs functionality.
In this matrix we investigate if some functionality meets the requirements or causes trouble as also as what could we do to fix it.

Also, someone may use this to have an overview of the requirements that each functionality has to satisfy.

The main parameters of the project:

- **Multilingual**
Is the functionality working well with multiple languages?

- **Multisite**
Is the functionality working well with a multisite installation that shares code and database?

- **One Subdomain per language**
Is the functionality working well for each Subdomain?

- **One (only) Database**
Is the functionality working well if we have one Datbase?

- **Drupal 8.x**
Is there a ready to use 8.x module to use? Is it working well? Are there any known issues?

- **Shared Media browser/management**
Is the functionality working well for the Media browser?

- **System Infrastructure**
Is the functionality working well with current [Infrastructure](infrastructure)? Do we need to add/remove packages or change settings?
